One of the main attractions of using blockchain is to avoid having to have a trusted thrid party, as often this is expensive and there is always still the uncertainty as to whether that thrid party is actually trustworthy. Additionally, blockchain makes information unique and transactions are often called immutable (it takes a huge effort to change an entry). This makes the blockchain attractive for many purposes, however in some cases it is either just not necessary or not as far advanced as it could be to be implemented efficiently. One such an example is when the data read into the blockchain is dependent on an outside physical device: although transactions are immutable, blockchain cannot ensure that date read in is actually correct. An example of such a company is Sunexchange. They use blockchain to measure from a physical device meter saying how much electricity was developed from the solar panels, which can be tampered with. This eliminates one of the major attarctions of blockchain: the trust, making it unnecessary to use.
