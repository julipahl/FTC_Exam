Our group project was about Stundet funding. We wanted to create a platform to make it cheaper for postgraduate students to take out loans for postgraduate studies, and also make it simplier and more transparent for investors to invest in these loans. 
We wanted to provide loans based on the likelihood of them being employed and the potential future income of these students, rather than there current financial situation or whether they have a guarantor who could assist them with interest payments (as the current bank loans do it). However this is very similar as to applying a credit rating to the student. Eventhough we would not explicitly give ratings to students, this may pose some regulatory issues. To do this we would need a banking license. 
Additional to build such a model to predict these outcomes, one would need a lot of information and data from some source (probably the respective universities) for which one would need to get through ethical approvals.
We had also planned on providing a secondary market where investors could trade their shares with other investors, this would need to be regulated.
Additionally, when providing a loan and investment platform, one needs to ensure that customer expectations are properly managed.
