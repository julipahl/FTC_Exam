## Challenges

I was not able to return the array of trues/falses in Question2.1. It only returns falses. I am not sure why it does not update for the trues. 
I did still include a check for the count of trues, as to how it would work if the function executed properly.
I also tried using mappings, however then I would end up not being able to return an array :). 

There were also some issues with deploying CoShoe.sol contract. I cannot find the bug, as all my other contracts migrated and deployed correctly... I hope it was an issue with my laptop.
